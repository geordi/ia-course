\subsubsection*{Step 1: Compute the Gradient Image}
For each image pixel $(x,y)$, compute the orientation of gradient as 
\begin{equation}
\varphi(x,y) = \arctan \left( \frac{f_y(x,y)}{f_x(x,y)} \right) \:,
\end{equation}
and the size of gradient as
\begin{equation}
e(x,y) = \sqrt{f_x^2(x,y) + f_y^2(x,y)} \:,
\end{equation}
where $f_x(x,y)$ and $f_y(x,y)$ are the differences of brightness in the $x$ and $y$ direction, respectively.
For their computing, we can use the following equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
f_x(x,y) &= f(x+1,y) - f(x,y) \:, \\
f_y(x,y) &= f(x,y+1) - f(x,y) \:.
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection*{Step 2: Create the Histograms}
Let the image be split into blocks of size $B_x \times B_y$, and let the blocks be split into cells of size $C_x \times C_y$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:hog}).
Create a histogram of gradient orientations in each cell.
Divide the range of orientations ($0-180$ or $0-360$ degrees) into $N$ bins (for example, with the step $20$ degrees that leads to $9$ bins for the interval $0-180$ degrees).
For each image pixel, add its gradient size into the bin representing the angle interval in which the gradient orientation of the pixel belongs.
Create such a histogram for each cell, and normalize the histograms within the blocks.

As a result of this method, we get a feature vector with the histogram values.
The size of the feature vector depends on the number of bins and on the number of cells in the image.
